CS-370_ReinforcementLearning

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
This project was an introduction to machine learning.  We were given most of the code as starter code.  However, we were assigned to complete the Q-learning algorithm under the TODO title in the Jupiter Notebook file.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  ### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
  Computer scientists automate tasks and create interfaces to connect humans together digitally and to bridge the gap between humans and information.
  ### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  To approach a problem as a computer scientist, you analyze a big problem and divide it into smaller problems.  Then, you develop pseudocode.  Then you begin writing the actual code module by module, testing the unit before moving to the next.
  ### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
  My ethical responsibilities include ensuring user data is secure and protected and that precautions are taken to create safe software that benefits many individual lives.
